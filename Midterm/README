The main file on the sensor board is sensor.py, it uses the following libraries:

- thermistor.py
  calculates and converts the temperature based on a Thermistor Temperature Sensor

- mqtt.py
  initialize connection to Adafruit dashboard through MQTT

The main file on the display board is display.py, it uses its own firmware, which
includes libraries:

- gc9a01
  display functions such as writing texts, filling the diaplay with color, etc.

- multiple fonts

Note that since the sensor board and display board run on different firmwares, and 
the display firmware does not have mqtt or BLE, I could not let the two boards 
talk remotely. So I made a compromise to wire them up and use UART to transmit data.
